I used to write silly little poems when I was in school. Wanted to save them somewhere so they don't get lost. :)

Some of them are pretty cringe, proceed with caution xD

# Just A Wall

I am standing here,

But still in no ones notice.

I am in the pic,

But out of focus.



I am the one,

They lean upon.

But I am also the one,

They spit on.



They think I wonâ€™t feel,

When they write their numbers on me.

They think I donâ€™t care,

When they touch me with their oily hair.



You donâ€™t know what its like being invisible,

You donâ€™t know what its like being non-divisible.

You donâ€™t know what its like being hit by a ball,

You donâ€™t know what its like being a wall.

# A Poetic Tribute To Fullmetal Alchemist

Sometimes I wish I was as determined as Ed and Al

Or that I had General Hughes as my pal.

I too want to be immortal,

But that means sacrificing something through the portal.



This is the law of equivalent exchange,

Trying to overcome which youâ€™ll get insane.

You think homunculi canâ€™t be reduced to dust.

Just think about Lust. (#RoyMustangRocks)



Survival of the fittest is the rule of the north,

This is irrelevant but I hate sloth.

The most powerful may not be what they seem,

Their plans may include making the innocent scream.



But if you want to save lives,

Then you have to have a hive.

With your effort their empire will fall,

Just remember all is one and one is all.



> Teenage and the desire to sound wiser than you are xD

# The Secret Of Life

The thing they didnâ€™t tell you,

When you were growing up,

Was that life may never be good,

That it might suck.



But in the worst of times,

If you remember these lines,

Then you may shine.



Hope is dangerous my friend,

It may burn you in the end.

You may never succeed,

But never follow someone elseâ€™s lead.



Cause even in the worst times,

Youâ€™ll hear your heartâ€™s chimes.

Just follow them â€™cause theyâ€™ll make you,

One of the great few.



If you want to enter the big league,

But donâ€™t know how to cope with defeat.

Then donâ€™t cry friend,

â€˜Cause time will reveal your efforts in the end.



Those who applause you right now,

Could stab you later.

You think relations are as strong as husk,

But even Caesar got stabbed by Brutus.



So surround yourself,

With the aura of your work.

Donâ€™t care what they say,

Just never give up.

# The Secret Of Happiness

Donâ€™t make that sad face,

As if you have fallen victim.

Time isnâ€™t the culprit,

Neither its your fate.



Time is continuous,

Itâ€™ll flow and bring happiness and hurdles,

But if you want to enjoy the journey,

Then donâ€™t treat everything like a burden.



Just as life has to be lived,

Duties have to be performed.

And if you want people to pity you,

Then you might never become one of the great few.



Key to happiness,

Is fulfilling two out of these three factors,

If you do something that,

You can do, have to do, and like to do,

Then my friend you are already one of the luckiest few.



If you fulfill two out of these three conditions,

Then also youâ€™ll be happy.

But if you donâ€™t,

Then go out and explore.



I guarantee you if you search enough,

Then youâ€™ll definitely find something,

One you find it stick to it like glue,

Because its something you have to do, can do, and like to do.

# The Secret Of Victory

The wise, the noble and the wealthy,

Can sometimes be turn coats,

The stupid, the cheats and the poor,

Can sometimes stay afloat.



This is what leads me to believe,

That people may not be who they seem.

And external factors never count,

â€˜Cause all you need is to remove self doubt.



If you can do that,

Then you have the key,

To wisdom, nobility and wealth,

Whichâ€™ll make you free.



So conjure up all your courage,

Have a strong heart in this battlefield,

If the challenges of this world are like a sword,

Then your self-confidence and courage are your shield.



Stand behind your shield bravely,

And attack with the weapon of wisdom,

Then and only then,

Youâ€™ll rule this kingdom.



> Why would I write a poem on Demonetization??? ðŸ˜­

# The Crook â€“ A poem on Demonetization

Money was all I wanted,

Until he spoke,

But now I feel haunted,

â€˜Cause I am broke.



I regret the money I took,

That businessmanâ€™s hand I shook,

I just canâ€™t forget that evil look,

In the eyes of that crook.



But I guess he is not the only one to blame,

Even I carry the burden of shame,

And now I regret the money that came,

I wish it had been in the bank account under my name.



I am sorry for the taxes I didnâ€™t pay,

And now comes inevitable reckoning day,

I wish I had followed what the law had to say,

Now I canâ€™t sleep still here I lay,

Above the money that once made me feel gay.



Now I stand in the long line,

For the money no longer feels mine,

I guess this is my fine,

For not paying the taxes is also a crime,

I promise not to repeat it the next time.
